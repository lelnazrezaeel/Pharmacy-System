# Pharmacy-System
The Pharmacy System project addresses the potential adverse interactions between different drugs and their impacts on diseases. It aims to provide healthcare professionals with information to make informed prescription decisions.
In this project, four different datasets provide the following information:

Drug Information Dataset: Contains drug names and their prices.
Disease Dataset: Includes the names of existing diseases.
Drug Interaction Dataset: Lists drugs, their effective counterparts, and the type of adverse effect.
Drug Sensitivity Dataset: Details the effects of drugs on specific diseases, indicating positive or negative effects.
The objective is to design a system that analyzes and displays drug information, diseases, drug interactions, and the effects of drugs on diseases. This empowers healthcare professionals to make optimal prescription choices.
